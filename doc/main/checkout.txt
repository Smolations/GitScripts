  [36m @usage [0;20;39m checkout [branch-name]
  
  [36m @description [0;20;39m
  This script assists with checking out a branch in several ways. Firstly, if you
  don't know the specific name of the branch for whatever reason, you can omit the
  branch name as the first parameter to view a list of all branches, even branches
  on the remote, if any. Secondly, You are automatically prompted to merge master into
  the branch which you are checking out to keep it current. In addition, safeguards
  are in place to prevent unnecessary processing if, for instance, you are already
  on the branch you are trying to checkout or the branch doesn't exist locally,
  remotely, or at all.
