  This file echoes a bunch of color codes to the terminal to demonstrate what's available.  Each
  line is the color code of one foreground color, out of 17 (default + 16 escapes), followed by a
  test use of that color on all nine background colors (default + 8 escapes).
  
  Each table cell has the same text within to get a sense of comparison. This text can be
  specified as the only parameter when calling this script. The script specifying numbers is
  followed by another color script which does not have numbers specified.
