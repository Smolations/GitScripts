  [36m @usage [0;20;39m branch [options] [search-string]
  
  [36m @description [0;20;39m
  This is a handy tool to filter local and/or remote branch names in your repository.
  It leverages the __get_branch function to let the user choose a branch. For more
  information on that part of the process,[36m  @see [0;20;39m functions/5000.get_branch.sh.
  
  
  [36m @options [0;20;39m
  -l, --local     Show only local branches.
  -q, --quiet     Do not show the informational message containing search query.
  -r, --remote    Show only remote branches.
  
  
  [36m @notes [0;20;39m
  - Search string CANNOT begin with a hyphen!
  - Passing both options above will result in showing ALL branches as expected.
  
  
  [36m @examples [0;20;39m
  1) branch --local part-of-bran
  # filters local branches that match "part-of-bran"
