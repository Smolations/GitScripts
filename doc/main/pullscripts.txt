  This is a quick way to update the GitScripts master branch. It takes note of the current branch
  and the current working directory of the user, updates master, then returns the user
  to his/her previous working conditions. Furthermore, the script will fail if there are
  changed/staged files in the working tree. Untracked files don't make a difference.
