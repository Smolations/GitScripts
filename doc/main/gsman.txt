  The GitScripts MANual is to GitScripts as the Man Pages are to Unix commands.
  The information for gsman entries can be as extensive as the user wishes. The
  gsman essentially looks for files in the gitscripts directory matching the
  given command name. It then parses those files for gsman comment blocks. These
  blocks take the form:
  
  ## /*[36m  @category [0;20;39m (optional)
  #[36m 	@oneLineTag [0;20;39m lorem ipsum
  #
  #[36m 	@tagBlock [0;20;39m
  #	Lorem ipsum blah blah....
  #
  ## */
  
  where the start of the comment is two pound signs (#) followed by a forward
  slash and asterisk, and the closing of the comment is two pound signs followed
  by an asterisk and a forward slash. This syntax closesly resembles block-style
  comments in CSS and other web languages. Tag names begin with the "at" symbol (@)
  and are followed by one or more letters of the alphabet. Common tags used are:
  
  [36m @usage [0;20;39m		<< This tag MUST be on the first line for the file to be gsman-compatible!

  --build-index[=main|user]    Build the files which are used for outputting gsman comments
  in an easy-to-read format. Also build command index files.
  If "user" is specified, only build the user index/help. If
  "main" is specified, only build the gitscripts core index/help.
  --list[=user|all),           Show a list of all the files which contain gsman comments
  and are accessible using the gsman command. If "user" is
  specified, only show commands that have been indexed from
  paths set in the $gitscripts_paths_user variable. If "all" is
  specified, show both user AND GitScripts native command lists.
  -h, --help                   Same as --list.
  
  
  [36m @notes [0;20;39m
  - The[36m  @usage [0;20;39m tag MUST be included on the first line (under ## /*) for the comments
  to be available in gsman!
  - If an option is given, omit the keyword. Both should not be used simultaneously.
