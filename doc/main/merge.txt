  [36m @description [0;20;39m
  This script is a helpful wrapper for merging one branch into another.
  
  If you have merge conflicts and you want to resolve them, running this command will get that
  started as long as you have your mergetool configured [TODO: Add documentation or link to
  documentation. For now, here is a link that I have not read the contents of, but this might
  get you started: http://www.davesquared.net/2009/02/setting-up-diff-and-merge-tools-for-git.html]
  
  If you are trying to initiate a merge of two branches, this script will do that too. The command
  is more intuitive (than "git merge") because it uses "into" to clearly distinguish merge direction.
  
  There are some helpful safeties included as well. Referenced branches
  are checked for existence before the script gets too far along, protected branches are checked,
  and merge conflicts are determined after the merge. If merge conflicts should arise, the
  user is prompted to resolve them using the native git mergetool.

  - If specifying both branches in the merge, the second parameter (which should be "into") is
  not explicitly checked. Technically, a user could successfully merge two branches with the
  command "merge branch1 flapjack branch2".
  
  
  [36m @examples [0;20;39m
  1) merge                             # Runs your pre-configured merge tool (because McCulloh can't remember how to make it run otherwise)
  2) merge master                     # Merges master into current branch
  3) merge my-branch into master      # Merges my-branch into master (unless master is a protected branch)
  4) merge my-branch another-branch   # This will fail. The second "action" parameter (into) must be included.
