  This script resets a handful of vars that should be reset to see changes immediately
  The intended purpose is for use in development, but it could also be used when
  running gs_refresh. After the reset, the user can choose to also refresh GitScripts.

  - The gitscripts_path variable should not be included as it is determined programmatically
  by the location of the _gsinit.sh file.
