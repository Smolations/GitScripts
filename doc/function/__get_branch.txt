  This is a handy tool to filter local and/or remote branch names in your repository.
  If you pass this function a search string, it will search for branch names which
  contain that string anywhere in the name (even in the remote name). It shows all
  branches as a menu and allows you to choose the branch by index.
  
  Default behavior is to show BOTH local and remote branches. To filter further, use
  one of the filter options described below. After a selection is made, it is made available
  in the variable $_branch_selection.
  
  
  [36m @options [0;20;39m
  -l, --local     Show only local branches.
  -q, --quiet     Do not show the informational message containing search query.
  -r, --remote    Show only remote branches.
  
  
  [36m @notes [0;20;39m
  - Search string CANNOT begin with a hyphen!
  - Passing both -l and -r options above will result in showing ALL branches as expected.
