  This script sets a variable that represents the name of a configured git remote repository.
  It first checks to see if the current branch is tracking a remote repository. If so, it
  "chooses" that remote. If not, it searches all the remotes for a git project and will present a menu
  to choose one if multiple remotes have been configured. If only one remote has been configured
  it will bypass the menu process and simply return that remote string. If no remotes are
  configured, the $_remote variable will not be set.
