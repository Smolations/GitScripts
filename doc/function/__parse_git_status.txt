  - If no parameter or an invalid parameter is given, the failure is logged and the
  the function returns status 1.
  - The output of the egrep command is intentionally suppressed as this function
  is intended to be used as a boolean in conditional expressions.
  - The data parsed is git status with the --short and -b flags included. This
  format will remain constant through Git versions and was intended for script
  parsing.
