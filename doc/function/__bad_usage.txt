  Makes error messages a little easier to read. They are prefixed with the command name,
  include coloring, and direct the user to use the GS Manual. However, if the user wishes
  to use this function with a command that has no gsman entry, option -o can be used
  and the reference to the gsman entry will be omitted.
  
  
  [36m @options [0;20;39m
  -o	Omit the reference to gsman for usage instructions. If this option is given, only the
  command_name is used. Any further parameters are ignored.
  
  
  [36m @notes [0;20;39m
  - A message cannot be given without a command name.
