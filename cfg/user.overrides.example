## /* @config
#	@description
#	This file, when copied into the same directory WITHOUT the .example extension will
#	override virtually any variable set through the various *.cfg files. This is also
#	where you should set any variable flags that control behavior via the flagged_actions.cfg
#	file. To see which variables you can overwrite and which flags you can set, view
#	the *.cfg files within the cfg/ directory.
#	description@
#
#	@notes
#	- Aliases set in aliases.cfg cannot be overridden from this file. You will have to
#	re-define them sometime after you have included the GitScripts bootstrap file (_gsinit.sh).
