[36m 	@usage  [0;20;39mnew <branch_name> [from <existing_branch>]

[36m 	@description [0;20;39m
	This script provides several ways to create a new branch. You will be able to create a branch
	based off of:
		1. Specified <existing_branch>
		2. The current branch you are on
		3. The master branch

	In addition, the branches will automatically be tracked and pushed up to any remotes you have
	configured. Don't worry, you will get the option to choose which remote you want the branch
	pushed to if you have configured more than one.


[36m 	@notes [0;20;39m
	- You will end on the new branch. That is, it will be the currently checked out branch.
	- The stash and reset options in the initial menu currently only work when your
	starting branch is the master branch.
